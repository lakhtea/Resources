Creating a new local repo and connecting it to GitHub repo

cd into directory/folder of your choice then run following commands in order

1.git init
2.touch README.md
3.echo "# {Directory Name}" >> README.md
4.git add README.md
5.git commit -m "first commit"
6.git branch -M main
7.git remote add origin {GitHub repo URL}
8.git push -u origin main

(To push to a different repo, simply repeat steps 7 & 8 but change origin to a different name)

After this you can simply use git pull to pull/git push to push
